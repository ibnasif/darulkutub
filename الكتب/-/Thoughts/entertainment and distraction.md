a researchworthy topic in itself, what is the line between entertainment and distraction? or does entertainment = distraction? 

at this point, i currently believe entertainment is used as a distraction from life, however both positively and negatively.

positive = using entertainment to relax and de-stress moderately
negative = using it in a way which makes it the focus of your day and your efforts, to the point that it distracts one from their real purpose or should i say lack of knowledge of their purpose. entertainment becomes their purpose


- “To find time for light entertainment is neither bad nor prohibited in Islam. But … if, instead of providing a genuine outlet for the stresses of life, entertainment becomes an objective in itself, it would be condemned as _laghw_ (vain and wasteful) in the Quranic terminology. When entertainment begins to interfere in the daily pursuits of life or takes a toll upon one’s time, which could be better spent otherwise, it too would be classified as vain…” (_Islam’s Response to Contemporary Issues_, p. 111)
