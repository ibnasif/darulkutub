every habit is initiated by a cue and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out

## few ways to redesign your environment:
- want to remember medication every night, put it near your bathroom tap
- if you want to drink more water, fill up a few water morning or night bottles and place them in common locations around the house

also create a separate space for different tasks, don't mix cues and environments with habits.  when you start mixing contexts of cues, you'll start mixing habits and the easier habits will win.

this is one reason why the versatility of modern technology like our phone is both a weakness and strength. it can do so much, we can't associate it with one task.
want to be productive? but then youre conditioned to check social media, play games etc whenever you open your phone. a mishmash of cues.

## one space, one use
by room or by zones 
a chair for reading, a desk for studying, 
#### every habit should have a home
