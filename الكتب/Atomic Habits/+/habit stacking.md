## after {current habit}, i will {new habit}

eg. after i pour my morning cup of coffee in the morning, i will stretch for 5 min


as you master this basic structure, you can then add more and create larger stacks
for example:

1. after i pour my morning cup of coffee, i will stretch for 5 min
2. after i stretch for 5 min, i will write my to do list for the day
3. after i write my to do list for the day, i will immediately begin with the first task

again, once you get better you can develop general stacks aka conditions

eg. 
- finances - when i want to buy something over Â£100, i will wait 24 hrs before purchasing
- forgetfulness - when i leave a public place, i will turn around and make sure i havent left anything behind                                                                                                                            


## tips:
- consider which time is most likely to be successful to build the habit
- your cue (original habit) should have the same frequency as your desired habit
- a way to find the right cue for your habit stack is to brainstorm a list of current habits:

make two columns, first column daily habits you already do without fail and second column things that happen each day without fail

1st column:
- get out of bed
- take a shower
- brush my teeth
- get dressed
- brew a cup of coffee
and so on...

2nd column:
-  the sun rises
- you get a text message
- the sun sets
- the five daily salawaat

whatever you do, BE SPECIFIC.
none of this read more or eat better.
