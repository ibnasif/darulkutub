bad habits are [autocatalyctic]
the process feeds itself. they foster the very feeling that you're using them to numb

you feel bad? eat junk food.
ate junk food? now you feel bad.

feel tired? watch tv
watched tv? now you feel like you dont have the energy to do anything else


cut bad habits off at the source. reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. ^5f4890
- if you cant get any work done, leave phone in a different room
- if youre wasting too much time on video games, unplug your console and put it away after each use

## make the cues of your good habits obvious and of bad habits invisible.
