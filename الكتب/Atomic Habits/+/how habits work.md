#### [[cue]]
triggers brain to initiate a behaviour and predicts and recognises a reward

#### [[craving]]
motivation/desire behind the force. you dont crave the habit, you crave the change in state it brings. you desire and want the reward

#### [[response]]
the actual habit, action/thought. you set out to get the reward

#### [[reward]]
end goal of habit


creates a habit loop, cue triggers a craving which motivates a response which provides a reward. reward now gets associated with the cue.


we can use these four srages to create a practical framework.

building habit, make it:
- obvious (cue)
- attractive (craving)
- easy (response)
- satisfying (reward)

breaking habit, make it:
- invisible 
- unattractive
- difficult
- unsatisfying
