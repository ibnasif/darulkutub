- in this book, clear reveals how these miniscule changes lead to life-changing outcomes.
- full of practical hack/tips 
- also delves into the psychology and neuroscience of habits 


## compound effect of small habits

![[1% -.png]]


- if you save a little now, you're not a millionaire
- if you study Arabic for an hour tonight, you still haven't learned the language
- if you go to the gym three days in a row, you're still not ripped

sadly, the slow pace of habits showing their effects has a negative impact on bad habits. it makes it easy to led bad habits slide

- eat an unheathy meal today and the scale won't move a lot
- work late tonight and ignore your family and they'll still forgive you
- procrastinate and put off your work or project until tomorrow and you will still have enough time to complete it

outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. time magnifies the margin between success and failure it will mutiply whatever you feed it. 

### "when nothing sems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two and I know it was not that last blow that did it - but all that had gone before" - jacob riis

progress from habits aren't linear, you often trudge away in the valley of disappointment at the start with few result. eventually enough work has been done to break past this plateau of latent potential.

( latent =  existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden or concealed.  )


## goals vs systems 

goals are about the results you want to achieve
systems are about the processes that lead to those results

real question is, if you ignore the goal and focus on the system would you still achieve the goal? yes

goals are best for setting a direction but a system is best for making progress

### "the score takes care of itself"


## problems of goals > systems mindset

#### #1 winners and losers have the same goals
- if successful and unsuccessful peple have the same goals then it can't be the goal that differentiaties them 

#### #2 achieving a goal is only a momentary change
- imagine you have a messy room and set a goal to clean it. you tidy it up and you'l have a clean room, however if you continue to have the same sloppy habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you'll be looking at a messy room again and waiting for another burst of motivation.
- you're left chasing the same outcome without changing the system behind it.
- you treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

#### #3 goals restrict happiness
- we have a clear problem of saying "once i reach this goal ill be happy"
- goals first mentality = putting off happiness until the next milestone 
- focusing on systems = in love with the process rather than the product, can be satisfied anytime your system is running.

#### #4 goals are at odds with long term progress
- once goal is achieved, what next?
- runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cros the finishing line they stop training as th race is no longer there to motivate 
- the purpose of setting goals is to win the game, purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.

**true long term thinking is goaless thinking.
it's not about any single accomplishment 
it's about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.**
