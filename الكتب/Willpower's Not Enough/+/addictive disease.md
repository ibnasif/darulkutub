there are 5 major factors that put people at a high risk for turning to a mood altering drug/activity, becoming infatuated and then being compelled to repeat it over and over again.

disclaimer: in addition to genetic predisposition in some chemical dependencies

## [[addictive belief system]]

having faulty beliefs such as believing that:
- it's possible to be perfect
- the world is limitless
- our image is more important than who we really are
- we are not enough
- externals (people, drugs, other things outside of ourselves) hold the solutions to life's problems

these addictive beliefs --> seduction by the promise of immediate gratification despite the deprivation of more substantial and long-lasting gratification in the long run.


## [[addictive personality]]

certain personality traits emanate from addictive beliefs

examples:
- perfectionism 
- emotional numbness
- approval seeking
- hypersensitivity to criticism and rejection 
- isolation


## [[inadequate coping skills]]

living in an increasingly addictive society and with addictive families that promote faulty beliefs.
therefore we aren't learning adequate coping and problem solving skills + have a lack of role models 

society and family teach us to turn to quick fix, short term solutions 


## [[unmet emotional, social and spiritual needs]]

unmet needs for acceptance, purpose, intimacy, community, security etc leave us with negative thoughts and feelings.

lack of coping skills and inability to tolerate the circumstances that come our way alongside our belief in short term, quick fix methods for these feelings (such as anxiety, anger, loneliness and depression), becomes the trigger for people to seek relief/comfort/distraction in addictions.


## [[lack of social supports]]

without a sense of belonging to a support network, it's ven harder to cope and problem solve and fix your cirumstances. this makes addictions even more appealing
