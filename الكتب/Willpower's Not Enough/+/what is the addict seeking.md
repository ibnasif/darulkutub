this current explosion of addictive behaviours in our osociety isn't occurring out of the blue 

**it is the product of our societal system** - a system that promotes 'quick-fix' solutions and offers little alternative gratification


### the needs that are desired through an addiction can be summed up in the following:

### [[a sense of belonging and intimacy]]

### [[a sense of meaning and purpose]]

### [[opportunities for fun and play]]

### [[a sense of autonomy and personal potence]]

### [[vitality and aliveness]]

### [[predictability and consistency]]

### [[self acceptance and self worth]]




many of these needs are fulfilled through islam.
- sense of belonging and intimacy - the brotherhood and sisterhood of islam and the emphasis of marital relations and strong family ties.
- sense of meaning and purpose - islam, al haqq. to worship Allah.
- fun and play - has its place in Islam, everyone has a different way to have fun.
- autonomy - islam teaches us heavily to not rely on others and only depend on Allah.
- alivenesss - knowing your Lord and your purpose is all you need to feel alive and content. in a physical sense, we have gym and exercise and training etc. v much a part of islam in order to prepare for jihad and defence and such
- predictability and consistency - a routine is definitely needed, salah helps us to structure this. consistency is mentioned many times in qur'an wa'lsunnah in terms of our deeds, even if theyre small.
- self acceptance and self worth - this is extremely easy once you realise who the One who created you is and if He can accept you and assign worth to you by guiding you and blessing you daily and having mercy on you, then you are an enemy to yourself to not accept yourself. however it is important to not go to extremes and assigning to high a value and becoming prideful.
