first:

### [[set a manageable goal]]


### [[don't taper off gradually]]



then:

### [[find a support group]]

### [[get professional help]]

### [[remove all sources of access to your drug and its reminders]]

### [[break off with people who make it available to you]]

### [[structure your time]]

during early abstinence, **ALL** of your free time must be structured. 

- schedule at least one safe and enjoyable activity for every evening
- plan each day in advance. *plan your weekend by wed/thur and your holidays a week or two earlier*

structuring time is comparable to putting a broken bone in a cast. it gives it time to heal, structure is necessary to keep you on track while you're getting through early recovery. a little like stabilisers
