## summary: 
- a book that helps recovering from [[addictions]] of every kind 
- a person who has lost control over a drug or activity can almost never control its use
- **source of [[addictions]] != drug/activity (rather it is the desire for a mood changer)** 




## [[habits]] vs [[addictions]]

addiction does not depend on frequency of use nor amount. 
rather it depends on the harm and problems it causes and your reason for doing so.



## symptoms of addiction

- obsession
- negative consequences
- lack of control
- denial


### trauma 

- 65% of teen drug addicts have at least one parent who is also an addict
- 50% of sex addicts were seually abused as children 
- physical violence, death or illness during a childhood can also lead to addiction

experiencing trauma as a child , sets the child up for addiction. in order to cope with the shame, helplessness and rage, the child develops a natural inclination towards wanting to numb his feelings. enter: drugs and its likes


### societal marketing  

- literally markets the addictions
- drugs, gambling, smoking, alcohol, sex all lead to millions and millions of deaths
- YET they are openly marketed
- money > morals
- society does not care


### normalisation of [[dishonesty]]

'' ours is a lying society ''

- from top to bottom, corrupt officials to lying family members. there are few role models for unwavering honesty.
- addiction thrives on dishonesty - denial
- dishonesty is promoted by society, parents practice one thing yet say another
- adverts are based on lies to sell products
- bribes are taken everywhere - fbi led a sting and 105/106 officials in NY accepted it.the one who rejected, only rejected because he wanted more

two key features of addiction are denial and secrecy. 

### [[television]]

- since 1950s, baby boomers were the first generation to be raised on television
- previous generations were reared in a slower-paced culture where reading required a certain amount of effort and perserverance 
- television provided instant 
- distraction and no effort was needed, one doesn't have to feel feelings
- tv distracts from feelings yet simultaneously stimulates 

- the rise of tvs also led to exposure of the same messages, ads, themes and role models to all children.
- led to thousands of advertisements of the latest gadget or clothes of food etc. branded to make the consumer happier, fitter, sexier, stronger etc.
- success of ads depend on convincing the consumer they are 
- a) not ok
- b) will be ok if they buy this product.

the belief that ' i am not enough ' is one of the most destructive and inaccurate beliefs that this generation has grown upon, also a predisposing factor for addiction.







## quotes 


#### "addictive behaviours produce pleasure, relief and other payoffs in the short run, but pain, grief and more problems in the long run"


#### ''isolation feeds addiction''

#### ''communities in the true sense barely exist anymore. individuals and families who share common basic values and goals, who partake in each other's joy and griefs, where each knows the other by name, history, weakness and strength''

### ''by understanding acurately his proper place in creation, a man may be made whole''
