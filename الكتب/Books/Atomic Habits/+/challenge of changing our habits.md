two reasons why our habits are so hard to change:
1. we try to change the wrong thing
2. we try to change our habits in the wrong way

as for the first, imagine there are three levels at which change can occur:

### 1. changing your outcomes 
this process is concerned with changing your results
eg. losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship

most goals we set are associated with this level

### 2. changing your process
concerned with changing your habits and systems
eg. implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow

most habits we build are associated with this level

### 3. changing your identity
concerned with changing your beliefs


outcomes = what you get
processes = what you do
identity = what you believe

## solution
focus on who we wish to become, build identity based habits.
focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve.``

the goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

double edged sword. identity change can be difficult once an identity has been adopted. 
"i'm not a morning person"
"im always late"
"im terrible with directions"
these people have already accepted their fate, they already accept is as a fact.
