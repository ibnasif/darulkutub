#### [[cue]]
triggers brain to initiate a behaviour and predicts and recognises a reward

#### [[craving]]
motivation/desire behind the force. you dont crave the habit, you crave the change in state it brings. you desire and want the reward

#### [[response]]
the actual habit, action/thought. you set out to get the reward

#### [[reward]]
end goal of habit


creates a habit loop, cue triggers a craving which motivates a response which provides a reward. reward now gets associated with the cue. 

- **infact, habits are a [dopamine driven feedback loop].  every habit forming behaviour is linked to higher levels of dopamine. 

- **dopamine is not only linked to pleasure but also plays a central role in many neurological processes such as motivation, learning, memory etc.

- **dopamine is not only released when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipiate it. it is the anticipation of a reward that gets us to take action, not the fulfillment of the reward. (*anticipation/thinking of a reward can feel better than the reward itself.*)


we can use these four srages to create a practical framework.

building habit, make it:
- obvious (cue)
- attractive (craving)
- easy (response)
- satisfying (reward)

breaking habit, make it:
- invisible 
- unattractive
- difficult ^5f4e89
- unsatisfying
